Ghost Shooter is a simple browser game where player can shoot ghosts/monsters by clicking the mouse. The player can move in 8 directions by using the arrow keys. The gun can be pointed using the mouse. Ghosts are killed when they are shot 5 times. The score is updated on the Heads-up Display on the top left corner of the screen. The player dies when the ghost comes in contact with the player. This is an unending game unless the player dies.

This game has been built by following a tutorial at Scirra.com available at the following link

I have personally added a few changes though, like creating little blast objects when the bullet hits the ghost and a large blast when the ghost has been killed. An even larger blast object is spawned whenever the player dies. I have modified the scoring accordingly to award points for non-fatal hits as well. The game restarts within 3 seconds after the player has been killed. The ghosts now move with different speeds. The high score is being recorded for a playing session. I have added a Home layout screen and an end game layout screen to restart the game.
