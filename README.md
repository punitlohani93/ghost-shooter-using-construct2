Ghost Shooter is a simple browser game where player can shoot ghosts/monsters by clicking the mouse. The player can move in 8 directions by using the arrow keys. The gun can be pointed using the mouse. Ghosts are killed when they are shot 5 times. The score is updated on the Heads-up Display on the top left corner of the screen. The player dies when the ghost comes in contact with the player. This is an unending game unless the player dies. Refresh to start again.

This game has been built by following a tutorial in Scirra.com at the following link

I have added a few changes though, like creating little blast objects when the bullet hits the ghost and a large blast when the ghost has been killed. I have modified the scoring accordingly to award points for non-fatal hits as well.
